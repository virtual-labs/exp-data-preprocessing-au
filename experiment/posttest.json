      "question": "Which of the following is the primary goal of data preprocessing?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To increase dataset size",
        "b": "To remove noise and inconsistencies",
        "c": "To replace machine learning models",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Increasing dataset size is not the primary goal of preprocessing.",
        "b": "Correct! Data preprocessing aims to clean and structure data for better model performance.",
        "c": "Machine learning models are used after preprocessing, not replaced by it.",

      "question": "Which technique is commonly used to handle missing values in a dataset?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Deleting the entire dataset",
        "b": "Filling missing values with mean, median, or mode",
        "c": "Ignoring missing values",
        "d": "Multiplying missing values by a factor"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Deleting the entire dataset is not a practical approach.",
        "b": "Correct! Imputation methods like mean, median, and mode help handle missing values.",
        "c": "Ignoring missing values can lead to biased results.",
        "d": "Multiplying missing values is not a valid technique."

      "question": "What is the purpose of text tokenization in data preprocessing?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To convert text into numerical features for machine learning",
        "b": "To remove stopwords from the dataset",
        "c": "To summarize large datasets",
        "d": "To encrypt textual data"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Tokenization splits text into individual words or phrases, making it suitable for ML models.",
        "b": "Stopword removal is a separate preprocessing step.",
        "c": "Summarization is different from tokenization.",
        "d": "Tokenization is not related to encryption."
