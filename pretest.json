        "a": "Text data needs preprocessing, but it's not the only type.",
        "b": "Numerical data also requires cleaning and scaling.",

      "question": "Why is data preprocessing important?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To make the data easier for machines to understand",
        "b": "To make machine learning models perfect",
        "c": "To remove all errors from the dataset",
        "d": "To generate more data"

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Preprocessing ensures data is in a structured format suitable for ML models.",
        "b": "ML models cannot be perfect; preprocessing helps improve accuracy.",
        "c": "Preprocessing reduces errors but may not remove all of them.",
        "d": "Preprocessing does not generate new data; it improves existing data."
